Hello {name},
My name is Temitope and I am a Backend Developer and a recent software engineering graduate from Alx Holberton.
I have been seeking an intern or junior role where I can make meaningful contributions while gaining real-world experience and expanding my skills at the same time.

I do not mind not getting paid if your budget won't allow it as I am more interested in learning and constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and expertise than I am in the financial benefits.

Unconventional as it may seem, can I get such an opportunity at {company}? I promise you'd smile back at this decision because I am confident in my ability to excel at this position and make a positive impact on your organization.

I am available to chat at your convenience to discuss how I can contribute to the success of your company.
I have attached my resume providing details about my projects and relevant experience.
